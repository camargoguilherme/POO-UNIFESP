// If you didn't have typescript make sure to install it globally by running the following code:
npm install -g typescript

// Install Typescript on the target folder to use it locally:
npm install typescript --save-dev

// Init Typescript by using:
./node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --init

// Create an output folder and compile:
./node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --outDir <your-output-folder>

// Run the index JS file that tsc created on the output folder:

```
